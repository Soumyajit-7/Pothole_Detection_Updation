# Pothole Detection and Updation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the **development of an advanced web application** that aims to improve road safety by leveraging cutting-edge deep learning and big data technologies. By connecting to users' car dash cams, the application automatically detects potholes in live footage and logs the relevant data for infrastructure management. This repository contains the logic for **pothole detection** and **data storage**, playing a key role in tracking and mapping road conditions for public safety.

## Features

### 1. **Pothole Detection via Dash Cams**
The application utilizes deep learning algorithms specifically trained for detecting potholes from dash cam footage. Our model has been fine-tuned for high accuracy, ensuring precise identification of potholes under various conditions like lighting, weather, and road types.

### 2. **MongoDB Integration for Data Storage**
Detected potholes are systematically logged into a **MongoDB database**, where each pothole is assigned a unique ID. The database stores crucial information such as:
- **Precise Geographical Coordinates** of the pothole
- **Contextual Information** (e.g., detection time, road conditions, severity)
- **Unique ID** for easy retrieval of individual potholes

MongoDB's scalable and flexible architecture ensures efficient handling of large datasets, making it an ideal choice for storing detailed information about each pothole.

### 3. **Granular Data Fetching**
The application allows users to **fetch individual documents** (representing potholes) from the MongoDB database, providing detailed information about each pothole, such as location and detection time. This makes it easier to track and manage road conditions.

### 4. **Interactive Mapping**
Using the precise geographical coordinates stored in the database, the system can dynamically **display potholes on an interactive map**. This feature gives users a clear, visual representation of the locations of potholes, contributing to informed decision-making about road safety and maintenance.

## Future Enhancements
While this repository is primarily focused on the **detection and data storing logic**, future releases could extend the applicationâ€™s capabilities to include:
- Real-time notifications for drivers
- Reporting features for municipalities to fix potholes
- Integration with smart city infrastructure for automated road repairs

## Prerequisites
- **MongoDB**: For data storage
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model deployment
- **Dash Cam Integration**: To feed live footage into the detection model

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Implementation in another repository)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), MongoDB for database management
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch models for real-time pothole detection
- **Mapping**: Mappls for geolocation and map interface
